# Natural-Language-Processing-with-RNN
Natural Language Processing (or NLP for short) is a discipline in computing that deals with the communication between natural (human) languages and computer languages. A common example of NLP is something like spellcheck or autocomplete. Essentially NLP is the field that focuses on how computers can understand and/or process natural/human languages.

Recurrent Neural Networks
In this tutorial we will introduce a new kind of neural network that is much more capable of processing sequential data such as text or characters called a recurrent neural network (RNN for short).

We will learn how to use a reccurent neural network to do the following:

Sentiment Analysis
Character Generation
